# Contributing to skills

Thanks for contributing! This document covers the conventions every change in this repository goes through.

CI, settings, and standards files here (including this document above the marker at the bottom) are managed by [Vivswan/repo-platform](https://github.com/vivswan/repo-platform); local edits to managed files are replaced on the next template sync.

## Pull requests

- Changes land through pull requests and are squash-merged; the PR title becomes the commit subject on the default branch.
- The PR title and every pushed commit subject must be a [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), for example `feat: add X` or `fix(parser): handle Y`. Releases are versioned from these subjects.
- By opening a pull request, or offering code in an issue or review for inclusion, you agree to the Contributions section of the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md), which licenses that code to the licensor - including for relicensing under any terms - unless you conspicuously say otherwise when you submit it.

## CI

- CI gates on the `all-green` status check - the CI workflow's own `all-green` job, which needs every gating job and fails unless each result is success or skipped, with at least one success (the convention is documented in [repo-platform's all-green guide](https://github.com/vivswan/repo-platform/blob/main/docs/all-green.md)).
- Repository-specific checks live in `.github/workflows/checks.yml`; run the commands it lists locally before pushing.
- A typography gate enforces plain ASCII punctuation: no curly quotes, em-dashes, or invisible unicode.

## Security

Never report vulnerabilities in issues or pull requests - see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the private reporting route.

## Creating a skill

Start from the files in [`template/`](./template), then add the new skill under [`skills/`](./skills). The full authoring guide lives in [`docs/authoring.md`](./docs/authoring.md).

At minimum, a new skill includes:

- `SKILL.md`
- `README.md`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `agents/openai.yaml` (interface mirroring the codex manifest)

If the skill needs MCP later, add a local `.mcp.json` based on the template example and keep the plain-skill fallback in `SKILL.md`.

## Skill structure

Each skill can contain:

- `SKILL.md`
- `README.md`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `agents/openai.yaml` (required Codex sidecar: interface; policy for explicit-invocation skills)
- `.mcp.json`
- `references/`
- `scripts/`
