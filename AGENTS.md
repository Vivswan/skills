# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents working in this repository.
`CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.github/agents.md` are
symlinks to this file, so edit only here.

## Project

Skills: Installable agent skills and plugin-ready workflows for coding agents

## Toolchain

- Runtime and package manager: bun (`bun install`, `bun test`, `bun run <script>`)
- See `package.json` scripts for the available commands.

## Conventions

- PR titles and commit subjects must be Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`,
  `feat!:`, `chore:`, ...). PRs are squash-merged, so the PR title becomes the
  commit subject and drives release-please versioning. CI validates both
  (the ci.yml pr-title job + validate-commit-names).
- CI gates on a single required check named `all-green` in the managed
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This repository's own test/lint jobs belong in
  `.github/workflows/checks.yml` (repo-owned, called inside the gate); do not
  edit ci.yml, template sync overwrites it. The `release` job runs on top
  of the gate (`needs: all-green`); the release pipeline is repo-owned in
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` (pre/post-release jobs go there, around the
  managed release-please machinery).
- No typographic look-alike characters (curly quotes, em-dashes, invisible
  unicode). CI enforces this with the check-typography action; use plain ASCII
  punctuation.

## Managed by repo-platform

- Files whose header says "managed by Vivswan/repo-platform"
  arrive via sync PRs pushed by that repository. Do not edit them here;
  change them in Vivswan/repo-platform and let the next sync
  PR deliver the update.
- Repository settings (description, topics, labels, rulesets, merge policy)
  are applied from Vivswan/repo-platform: by the
  `settings/repos/` file named after this repository over there when one
  exists, otherwise by this repository's own `.github/settings.yml`. Do not
  change settings by hand in the GitHub UI; edit the settings file.
- Repo-owned escape hatches stay local: `.github/workflows/checks.yml` and
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `.gitignore`'s marked LOCAL section,
  `.typography-allow.local` (typography exemptions; the managed
  `.typography-allow` is overwritten by sync), and the repository-specific
  section below.
- Module selection is this repository's own: edit the `modules` list in
  `.repo-platform.yml` and the next sync PR applies the change.

## Repository-specific guidance

<!-- Add project-specific instructions below. This section survives template
