# Verify With Controls

> A reading is not a finding. Before "no matches" (a zero), "half the checks vanished" (an alarm), "the work landed" (a success claim), or "nothing is running" (stillness) becomes a claim, the reading must survive its controls: evidence attached, a positive control behind every zero, the instrument suspected, the postcondition checked, a re-measure at the moment of sending, and a checker that has been seen failing.

Six rules, each distilled from a false conclusion nearly shipped in production:

| # | Rule | The failure it kills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Evidence or error, never a bare zero | one 0 for both "absent" and "I failed to look" |
| 2 | Positive control before trusting a zero | a blind instrument answering the wrong question truthfully |
| 3 | Suspect the instrument first | a plausible number measuring the wrong thing |
| 4 | The postcondition is the truth | success logs over a state that never changed |
| 5 | Two observations to look, re-measure to send | a report racing the state it describes |
| 6 | Negative control for checkers | a gate that cannot go red |

## 1. Evidence or error, never a bare zero

A probe that can return 0 both for "absent" and for "I failed to look" is broken by construction. No amount of care in reading its output fixes it; the two meanings arrive as the same byte.

```bash
$ git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD -- src/fetaure/
$        # empty, exit 0: reads as "this branch touched nothing there"
```

One transposed letter, and the pathspec matches nothing that ever existed. "No changes under the path" and "I probed the wrong place" arrive as the same empty, successful reading; a run of zeros with this shape nearly reported real, landed work as missing.

A sound probe proves the question was answerable before trusting the zero, and errors on a reading it could not take. Validate the pathspec against the same endpoints the measurement reads. Three traps hide in that sentence: a three-dot diff compares the MERGE BASE with HEAD, not the two named tips; a failed validation exiting 0 is just another bare zero; and a pipe returns only its last command's status, so `pipefail` keeps a failed `ls-tree` from hiding behind the other endpoint's match:

```bash
$ set -o pipefail
$ base=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD) &&
    { git ls-tree -r --name-only "$base" -- src/fetaure/ &&
      git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD -- src/fetaure/; } | grep . ||
    { echo "ERROR: no trustworthy reading (instrument error above, or pathspec at neither endpoint)" >&2; exit 1; }
ERROR: no trustworthy reading (instrument error above, or pathspec at neither endpoint)    # and exit 1
```

The broken zero becomes a loud, non-zero error. On a pathspec present at either endpoint (including one the branch deleted entirely) the same probe prints the matched paths and exits 0, so a pass carries its evidence too, and only then is an empty diff a reading. Non-zero readings report their matched lines the same way, never the count alone.

Corollary: every narrowed variant of a working probe is a NEW probe. Prove the narrowed form returns non-empty on a case that must match before trusting its empty. Worked example: a stash was probed for work under one path by narrowing a command that had just worked:

```bash
$ git stash show --numstat 'stash@{0}'                          # works: prints the stash's files
$ files=$(git stash show --numstat 'stash@{0}' -- docs/ 2>/dev/null)
$ echo "${files:-nothing under docs/}"
nothing under docs/
```

The stash DID hold work under `docs/`. `git stash show` takes no pathspec, so the narrowed command measures nothing; its complaint went to the discarded stderr, and the captured stdout was empty either way. The control that exposes it: run the narrowed form on a path the stash MUST contain, and watch it read empty there too, before its empty means anything.

## 2. Positive control: one reading that must be non-zero

Before trusting any zero or absent reading, take one reading that MUST be non-zero through the same instrument. An empty world and a blind instrument produce the same zero; only the control separates them.

A landing checker with the wrong repository root hardcoded reported two landed files as DROPPED. Every reading it took was internally consistent, a truthful answer to the wrong question: the tree it probed could never contain the files.

```bash
$ landed-check docs/new-guide.md   # 0 - alarming reading, do not report yet
$ landed-check README.md           # control: known present, must read non-zero
0                                  # it reads zero -> the instrument is blind
```

One extra command turns "the files are gone" into "my checker cannot see", before the alarm ships.

## 3. Could my instrument be the broken part?

Before reporting an alarming reading, re-derive it a second way. An instrument defect produces a confident, plausible, wrong number, and nothing about a plausible number looks broken.

```bash
$ gh pr checks 123 | tr -s ' ' '\t' | awk -F'\t' '{print $2}' | grep -c pass
10        # of 14 known checks - four "missing"?
```

Check names containing spaces split into extra fields, so field two was not the status column on every row: 10 of 14 is a plausible number measuring the wrong thing. The second derivation skips the parse entirely and disagrees:

```bash
$ gh pr checks 123 --json state --jq 'map(.state) | group_by(.) | map({(.[0]): length})'
[{"SUCCESS":14}]
```

When two derivations disagree, suspect the instruments before the world, and keep the reading out of any report until they agree.

## 4. Logs approximate; the postcondition is the truth

Exit codes catch hard failures. Output verdicts catch soft aborts, where a tool prints its own failure and exits 0. Neither substitutes for verifying the state you needed. Two production shapes:

```text
$ sync-tool push
  ERROR: Push failed (remote rejected)
Sync finished successfully.
$ echo $?
0         # the tool's verdict line and its exit code both read success
```

```text
$ merge-queue add 456
queued OK       # success means ENQUEUED; the commits are not on the mainline yet
```

Both messages are honest about the wrong thing. The claim you need is about the world, so check the world:

```bash
$ git fetch origin main && git merge-base --is-ancestor "$sha" FETCH_HEAD && echo landed
```

Is the ref actually where it must be? That is the postcondition. The log only ever approximates it. (Test `FETCH_HEAD`, the ref the fetch just wrote: whether `origin/main` itself updates depends on the remote's configured fetch mapping, and a stale remote-tracking ref approximates the same way a log does.) Ancestry is conclusive only when the landing preserves commit ids: squash, rebase, and cherry-pick landings all rewrite `$sha`, so there a failed ancestry check proves nothing by itself. For those, the postcondition is the content itself at `FETCH_HEAD` (the changed files' exact content present at the fetched tip), with a subject match used at most to locate the landing, never as the check (a squash can rewrite the subject too).

## 5. Two observations before a flag, re-measure before sending

State changes race your report. Two bars with different jobs:

- Two observations across an interval decide whether to LOOK: a single still reading is not stillness.
- A fresh re-measure immediately before sending decides whether to SEND. Every near-false-alarm in production died at that final re-measure, never at the first reading.

```text
reading 1                  no change      -> keep watching, not a flag yet
reading 2                  still no change -> the flag is earned on this evidence
re-measure before sending  changed 37 seconds ago -> withhold; the claim went stale
```

A flag that met the bar on genuine evidence can still be wrong by the time it sends. A conclusion is bound to the moment it was measured, and sending it asserts it NOW, so measure it now. The same applies to retracting one: a retraction is a claim about current state too.

## 6. Negative control: prove the checker can fail

A gate that cannot go red verifies nothing, and a checker that has never been seen failing proves nothing when it passes. Feed it a sentinel that MUST fail, through the same assertion path the real checks use; a separate test-the-test path controls the wrong instrument.

```ts
// The real checks and the control share assertContains, so the control
// certifies the exact code path every green check ran through.
test("negative control: the shared assertion fails on an impossible token", () => {
  expect(() => assertContains(doc, "zzImpossibleToken414")).toThrow();
});
```

For a checker that verifies a landing or a deployment, run it against a state that must fail (the pre-landing ref, a tree without the files) and watch it go red there before trusting its green.

## At the moment of concluding

The rules compress into one pass, run right before the conclusion leaves your hands:

1. Zero or absent reading: is the probe evidence-or-error (1), and did a positive control pass through the same instrument (2)?
2. Alarming reading: re-derived a second, independent way (3)?
3. "It succeeded": checked the postcondition, or only a log that approximates it (4)?
4. Stillness or absence over time: two observations, then a re-measure immediately before sending (5)?
5. A green checker: has it ever been seen red (6)?

## Review Criteria

Skills that run code reviews (such as `/rubber-duck-review`) expand this section into their reviewer prompt when this skill is installed. Ask the reviewer to flag:

- probes or checks that can return the same value for "absent" and for "failed to look": swallowed errors, unvalidated paths, a grep or filter whose zero is trusted bare
- checkers and gates with no negative control: nothing proves they can fail through the same assertion path their green runs through
- success concluded from a log line or exit code where the postcondition itself is checkable

Triage the resulting findings with the pass in "At the moment of concluding" above.
