# Claude Remote Peers

> Two Claude Code sessions on different machines message each other the way two sessions on one machine do: a write into a Unix socket wakes the other side. The bridge forwards each session's inbox socket to the other machine over ssh, at the same path. Nothing is copied, nothing polls.

## The specimen

Two dev boxes, one Claude Code session on each. `ListAgents` on box A showed no peers. The bridge ran from box A's session shell:

```text
$ bun "<skill-dir>/scripts/bridge.mts" box-b
bridge up: session-b (pid 2002 on box-b), bridge pid 4242
SendMessage to: uds:/tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock
they reply to:  uds:/tmp/cc-socks-1000/1001.sock
```

`SendMessage` with `to: uds:/tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock` reached box B. Box B's session replied to the `from` address in the message, and the reply landed in box A's turn on its own:

```text
<cross-session-message from="uds:/tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock" from-name="session-b" from-mode="bypass">
bridge ok
</cross-session-message>
```

No file was written to either machine's `~/.claude`.

## Workflow

1. **Start the bridge in the background**, from a shell inside this session (its Bash tool inherits `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET`). `<destination>` is anything `ssh` accepts.

   ```bash
   nohup bun "<skill-dir>/scripts/bridge.mts" <destination> > /tmp/claude-remote-peers.log 2>&1 < /dev/null & disown
   ```

   A specific remote pid, or extra ssh options after `--`:

   ```bash
   bun "<skill-dir>/scripts/bridge.mts" box-b 2002
   bun "<skill-dir>/scripts/bridge.mts" user@10.0.0.7 -- -p 2222 -i ~/.ssh/other_key
   ```

2. **Wait for the `SendMessage to:` line** in the log. It is printed only after the script has confirmed both forwards, the remote one over ssh; a socket file that appears earlier is not yet known to work.

3. **Send with the printed address as `to`.** The remote sees a normal `<cross-session-message>`; it replies to the `from` address and needs nothing from you.

4. **Replies are pushed.** They arrive as `<cross-session-message>` and start a turn here. Never poll the log, the socket, or the remote registry for them.

5. **Stop the bridge when done** with the `bridge pid` from the `bridge up` line. Teardown removes the two forwarded sockets and logs `cleanup done`; a failed remote removal is logged and exits 1.

   ```bash
   kill 4242
   ```

## Without bun

The same in shell. The remote pid and socket come from its registry; `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET` is this session's own inbox. Both checks stop the function before anything is forwarded, so a path that is already a live inbox on either side is never forwarded over or removed; a socket path containing a quote character needs the script, which quotes for the remote shell.

```bash
h() { ssh -o ClearAllForwardings=yes box-b "$@"; }   # helper commands drop config forwards that would collide with the tunnel's
h 'cat ~/.claude/sessions/*.json'      # pick a live one; note its messagingSocketPath, e.g. /tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock

bridge() {
  unset bridge_pid                                      # the cleanup below acts only on a forward this call started
  mkdir -p -m 700 /tmp/cc-socks-1000                    # their socket dir, needed here when the uids differ
  test ! -e /tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock || { echo "a local session owns that path; stop"; return 1; }
  h "mkdir -p -m 700 '${CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET%/*}' && test -w '${CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET%/*}' && test ! -e '$CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET'" \
    || { echo "our path on box-b is taken or its directory is not writable, or ssh failed; stop"; return 1; }
  ssh -o ControlPath=none -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -N \
         -L /tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock:/tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock \
         -R "$CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET:$CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET" box-b &   # no connection sharing: the forwards must die with this pid
  bridge_pid=$!
}
bridge && sleep 2 && kill -0 "$bridge_pid" && h "test -S '$CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET'" && echo "bridge up"   # a refused forward makes ssh exit; replies need the -R socket on box-b
# SendMessage to = uds:/tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock

# afterwards; bridge_pid is set only by a bridge() call that started the forward
[ -n "$bridge_pid" ] && { kill "$bridge_pid"; rm /tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock; unset bridge_pid; h "rm -f '$CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET'" || echo "remove $CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET on box-b by hand"; }
```

## What the bridge does not do

- **It does not list the remote in `ListAgents`.** Listing reads only the local registry. Address the remote by the `uds:` path the script prints.
- **It does not copy registry records or key files.** Why that works and why a copy would be worse: [addressing and auth](references/protocol.md#the-five-facts-the-bridge-rests-on) and [why the bridge copies nothing](references/protocol.md#why-the-bridge-copies-nothing).
- **It leaves nothing running on the remote** except the ssh session holding the forwards. The lookup, the prechecks, and the cleanup are short ssh commands that exit. No Claude process is spawned, resumed, or forked.

## Gotchas

| You see | It means | Do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `no live Claude Code session with a messaging socket on box-b` | no session over there, or its socket is gone | start or check the remote session, rerun |
| `could not read the session registry on box-b` | ssh failed, `python3` is missing there, or `~/.claude/sessions` is unreadable | run `ssh box-b python3 --version`; the line above it carries the remote error |
| `ssh to box-b failed (exit 255)` | the free-path check never reached the remote | fix ssh first: `ssh -v box-b true` |
| `<path> already exists on this machine` or `on <destination>` | a session on that side has the same pid as the one being forwarded, or a stale forward was left behind | restart one session or remove the stale socket, rerun |
| `ssh exited (255) before the forwards came up` | the tunnel died during startup; ssh's own error is the line above it (a refused forward, a failed login) | fix what ssh reported, rerun |
| `forwarded socket /tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock never appeared within 60 s` | ssh stayed up but never created the `-L` socket here | check `ssh -v box-b`, confirm OpenSSH 6.7+ on both ends |
| `reverse forward did not bind /tmp/cc-socks-1000/1001.sock on box-b within 60 s` | ssh stayed up (a refused `-R` would have ended it) but the socket never showed at that path on box-b: its sshd session sees a different `/tmp` (PrivateTmp, a container), or the bind is still pending | from an `ssh box-b` shell run `ls -ld /tmp/cc-socks-<uid>`; point `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` at a directory both see |
| `could not verify the reverse forward` | the probe's own ssh connection failed after the tunnel came up; the bridge tore down | fix ssh first: `ssh -v box-b true`, rerun |
| `could not create a writable /tmp/cc-socks-<uid> on box-b` | the remote `/tmp` refused the directory, or it exists there owned by another account (a leftover from a root session) | check `ls -ld /tmp/cc-socks-<uid>` there; chown it or point `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` elsewhere on both sides |
| `Timed out sending to /tmp/cc-socks-1000/2002.sock` from `SendMessage` | the remote session exited; the forward leads nowhere | stop and rerun the bridge; it picks the newest live session |
| `[Cross-session delivery notice] ... held` | permission-mode mismatch; the remote user must approve | wait, or ask them to set `crossSessionInbound` to `accept` |

Different uids on the two hosts give different socket directories (`/tmp/cc-socks-<uid>`); the script creates the missing directory on each side. Windows receivers require the auth token, so the no-copy design does not hold there.

The protocol facts behind all of this, with diagrams, are in `references/protocol.md`.
